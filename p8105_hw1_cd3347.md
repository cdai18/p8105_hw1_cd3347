  - Weather station.

- year, month day, hour

  - Time of recording.

- temp, dewp

  - Temperature and dewpoint in F.

- humid

  - Relative humidity.

- wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust

  - Wind direction (in degrees), speed and gust speed (in mph).

- precip

### Size of dataset

In this dataset, `nrow = 358` and `ncol = 15`.

### Mean temperature

``` r
#weather_df = early_january_weather
#  mean(weather_df$temp)

mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

The mean temperature is for the dataset is 39.58 degrees.

### Scatterplot

The graph shows an increase in temperature through the first weeks of
January. It also shows that humidity increased as time passed.
