### Scatterplot

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, 
                                  colour = humid)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("weather_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

The graph shows a general increase in temperature through the first
weeks of January. It also shows that humidity increased as time passed.
Temperature appears to increase during the day and decrease at night.
Also, there is a drop in temperature from the overall increase starting
about January 15 from about 68 degrees F to 35 degrees F.

# Problem 2

## Creating the data frame

``` r
set.seed(1)

problem2_df = tibble(
 x = rnorm(10),
 greater_than_0 = c(x > 0),
 earth_wind_fire = c("Do", "you", "remember", "the", "21st", 
                     "night", "of", "September", "!", "!"),
 government = factor(c("executive", "executive", "executive",
                       "legislative", "legislative", "legislative", 
                       "judicial", "judicial", "judicial", "judicial"))
)

problem2_df 
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##         x greater_than_0 earth_wind_fire government 
    ##     <dbl> <lgl>          <chr>           <fct>      
    ##  1 -0.626 FALSE          Do              executive  
    ##  2  0.184 TRUE           you             executive  
    ##  3 -0.836 FALSE          remember        executive  
    ##  4  1.60  TRUE           the             legislative
    ##  5  0.330 TRUE           21st            legislative
    ##  6 -0.820 FALSE          night           legislative
    ##  7  0.487 TRUE           of              judicial   
    ##  8  0.738 TRUE           September       judicial   
    ##  9  0.576 TRUE           !               judicial   
    ## 10 -0.305 FALSE          !               judicial

## Pulling variables and taking their means

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, x))
```

    ## [1] 0.1322028

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, greater_than_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, earth_wind_fire))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, earth_wind_fire)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, government))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, government)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

When taking the means of the variables in the problem2_df data frame, we
get a numerical value for our random sample, “x”, and for the logical
vector, “greater_than_0”. However, for the character vector and factor
vector (“earth_wind_fire” and “government”), we get warning that says
“argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA\[1\] NA”.

## Using the as.numeric function

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, greater_than_0))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, earth_wind_fire))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, government))
```

When we use the as.numeric function on the logical, character, and
factor vectors, we get set of binary numbers for the logical vector, NA
for the character vector, and groupings of numbers for the factor
vector. This helps to explain what happens when we try to take the mean
of each vector. For the logical vector, there are binary numbers, 1 and
0, corresponding to TRUE and FALSE, that can be used to calculate a
mean. For the character vector, there are no numeric values to calculate
a mean from, which is why the as.numeric function returns NA. For the
factor vector, each level is attributed to 1, 2, or 3. Since the levels
are not numerically meaningful, a mean cannot be calculated.
